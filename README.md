# SQ280-polytope-graphs
Playing around with visible graphs and polytopes.


This is my class project for SQ 280-01. Looking at unitary operations on polyhedras - specifically on the behavior of the visible graphs under these operations. Written in python, using openGL/MESA for graphics heavy lifting and Sage for some math operations.
